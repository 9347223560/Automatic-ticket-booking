# Automatic-ticket-booking
This project is a Verilog-based automatic ticket booking system for subway transportation. The system efficiently processes user inputs, calculates fares, issues tickets, and returns change if necessary. It is implemented using Hardware Description Language (Verilog) and tested on FPGA simulators like Xilinx ISE, ModelSim, or Vivado.
